# TTODO API - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Product**: TTODO API
**Version**: 2.0 (12-Month Roadmap)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Active Development

TTODO is an enterprise-grade personal productivity platform that combines TODO management with gamification elements to drive user engagement and habit formation. Built on Spring Boot 3.5 with Domain-Driven Design architecture, it provides a scalable foundation for personal productivity tools.

### Vision
To become the most developer-friendly and feature-rich TODO management API that seamlessly integrates with modern productivity ecosystems while maintaining enterprise-level quality and security.

### Core Value Propositions
1. Enterprise Architecture: DDD with CQRS, enabling clean separation of concerns
2. Developer Experience: Comprehensive API documentation, predictable behavior
3. Gamification: XP/level system and challenges to boost user motivation
4. Flexibility: Advanced recurrence rules (RFC 5545), virtual instances, dynamic queries
5. Security: JWT with RSA signing, Redis-backed sessions, comprehensive validation

## Current State (Q4 2025)

### Implemented Features

**Authentication & User Management**
- JWT authentication with RSA key pair signing
